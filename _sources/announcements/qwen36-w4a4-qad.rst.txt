Weight-only NVFP4 does not make this model faster. On Blackwell, a BF16 activation forces vLLM onto
the Marlin dequant-to-BF16 fallback, which never reaches the FP4 tensor cores: W4A16 measured
*slower* than BF16 in 10 of 12 shapes. Quantizing activations as well (W4A4) unlocks those kernels
and beats BF16 in 9 of 12 shapes, but costs accuracy that post-training quantization alone does not
recover. Quantization-Aware Distillation (QAD) is what closes that gap.

We ran the full flow on `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B <https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B>`_ with
Megatron-Bridge: W4A4 NVFP4 PTQ, then 500 QAD iterations against the BF16 teacher, evaluated across
six benchmarks. The complete reproduction steps, configs and recipe are in the
`tutorial <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/megatron_bridge/tutorials/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B>`__.

Highlights
**********

* **W4A4 is the configuration worth targeting.** It beats BF16 in 9 of 12 measured shapes (up to
  1.30x) and shrinks the checkpoint from 67 GiB to 22 GiB (3.1x). Weight-only W4A16 is slower than
  BF16 in 10 of 12.
* **Only 2 of 6 benchmarks lost measurable accuracy to W4A4**, so those are the only two where QAD
  has anything to recover.
* **IFBench is fully recovered.** PTQ costs 2.6 pp; 500 QAD iterations return the model to
  statistical parity with BF16.
* **MMMU-Pro recovers about 40%** of its deficit and retains a measurable gap — the blend is
  text-only, and MMMU-Pro is multimodal.
* **Repeat counts matter more than expected.** At 3 repeats one benchmark showed a 3 pp swing that
  vanished at 8, and IFBench's real gain was invisible until 8.

Where QAD Helps
***************

Only IFBench and MMMU-Pro show a W4A4 deficit larger than run-to-run noise. On the other four,
W4A4 is effectively lossless and QAD neither helps nor hurts.

Throughput

Measured with AIPerf against a served vLLM endpoint on 4x GB200, three ISL/OSL shapes at four
concurrencies each (output tokens/s):

W4A4 loses to BF16 only at concurrency 1, by a near-constant 0.87–0.88x across all three shapes.
That is fixed per-call overhead in the FP4 kernel path, which batch-1 decode has no arithmetic
intensity to amortize — not a recipe knob.

What It Costs
*************

QAD dominates: 500 iterations at 32K sequence length on 32 nodes (128 GB200) took 5.7 hours,
about 735 GPU-hours. PTQ is 9 minutes and the HF export a few more. Evaluating one checkpoint
across all six benchmarks at the repeat counts above is roughly 100 GPU-hours.

has the full reproduction path — data blend, PTQ recipe, QAD command, export, and one NeMo Evaluator
config per benchmark — plus the parallelism constraints QAD imposes on this model and what we would
try next to close the remaining MMMU-Pro gap.
