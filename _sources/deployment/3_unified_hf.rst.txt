Unified HuggingFace Checkpoint
=================================================================

We support exporting modelopt-optimized Hugging Face models (transformers and diffusers pipelines/components) and Megatron Core models to a unified checkpoint format that can be deployed in various inference frameworks such as TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and SGLang.

The workflow is as follows:

#. Load the Huggingface models or Megatron Core models, `quantize with modelopt <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/hf_ptq#ptq-post-training-quantization>`_ , and export to the unified checkpoint format, where the layer structures and tensor names are aligned with the original checkpoint.
#. Load the unified checkpoint in the supported inference framework for accelerated inference.


Export Quantized Model
======================

The modelopt quantized model can be exported to the unified checkpoint format stored as

#. A group of safetensors files, containing quantized model weights and scaling factors.
#. A ``hf_quant_config.json`` file containing quantization configurations.
#. Other json files that store the model structure information, tokenizer information, and metadata.


The export API (:meth:`export_hf_checkpoint <modelopt.torch.export.unified_export_hf.export_hf_checkpoint>`) can be used as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from modelopt.torch.export import export_hf_checkpoint

    with torch.inference_mode():
        export_hf_checkpoint(
            model,  # The quantized model.
            export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
        )

.. note::
   ``export_hf_checkpoint`` also supports diffusers pipelines and components (e.g., UNet/transformer). See the
   diffusers quantization examples for end-to-end workflows and CLI usage.

Deployment Support Matrix
==============================================

Supported Quantization Formats
------------------------------

The unified HF export API supports the following quantization formats:

1. FP8 - 8-bit floating point
2. FP8_PB - 8-bit floating point with per-block scaling
3. NVFP4 - NVIDIA 4-bit floating point
4. NVFP4_AWQ - NVIDIA 4-bit floating point with AWQ optimization
5. INT4_AWQ - 4-bit integer with AWQ optimization
6. W4A8_AWQ - 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations with AWQ optimization
7. IQ1_S - 1-bit codebook quantization using the GGML block layout
8. IQ2_XS - 2-bit codebook quantization using the GGML block layout

.. note::
   GGML has no equivalent for ModelOpt's per-tensor FP8 weight-and-activation format. In particular,
   GGML does not define a first-class FP8 tensor type with the corresponding per-tensor weight and
   activation scale semantics. Converting a ModelOpt FP8 checkpoint to GGUF therefore requires
   conversion to another GGML-supported tensor type rather than a lossless FP8 encoding.

IQ weight representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For IQ1_S and IQ2_XS, unified export replaces each floating-point ``<module>.weight`` with a
``uint8`` tensor containing byte-exact GGML blocks. Its shape is
``[*logical_shape[:-1], logical_shape[-1] // 256, payload_bytes]``, where ``payload_bytes`` is 50
for IQ1_S and 74 for IQ2_XS. No separate shape tensor is stored: a loader recovers the logical
shape as ``[*weight.shape[:-2], weight.shape[-2] * 256]``. This is unambiguous because IQ export
requires the logical last dimension to be divisible by 256.

.. note::
   Megatron IQ export currently requires tensor and pipeline model parallel sizes of 1. Packing
   happens during export, so a tensor-parallel shard would be packed as if it were a whole
   weight, and a pipeline stage holding no IQ layer would not reach the same rejection as its
   peers. Expert parallelism is supported, assuming every expert uses the same format.

.. warning::
   Megatron fused-MoE IQ export is not currently supported. Its packed tensor would require the
   deployment consumer to understand
   ``[num_experts, out_features, in_features // 256, payload_bytes]`` rather than the ordinary HF
   fused-expert order. The exporter raises ``NotImplementedError`` until a deployment loader owns
   this layout and is covered by an integration test. Dense and individually named expert weights
   continue to use the representation above.

The generated configuration records ``quant_method: modelopt``, ``packing: ggml``, the 256-value
block size, and the payload byte count. IQ payloads are not represented as compressed-tensors
integer ``weights`` groups because all scales and indices are embedded in each packed block.

Each 74-byte IQ2_XS block represents 256 logical weights:

* bytes 0--1 are the little-endian FP16 super-block scale ``d``;
* bytes 2--65 are 32 little-endian ``uint16`` codes, one per group of eight weights. Each code
  contains a 9-bit codebook index and seven stored sign bits; the eighth sign bit is derived from
  parity; and
* bytes 66--73 contain sixteen 4-bit local-scale codes, packed two per byte. Each local scale is
  shared by two adjacent eight-weight groups.

The canonical 512-by-8 IQ2_XS codebook is part of the implementation rather than the checkpoint.
The complete block therefore costs ``74 * 8 / 256 = 2.3125`` bits per logical weight.

Minimum Framework Versions
--------------------------

===============  =================
Framework        Minimum version
===============  =================
TensorRT-LLM     v1.2.0
vLLM             v0.10.1
SGLang           v0.4.10
===============  =================

These are the oldest versions expected to load a unified HF checkpoint. The deployment suite itself
targets newer ones — TensorRT-LLM containers in ``.github/workflows/`` are on the 1.3.x line. Older
TensorRT-LLM releases may still serve FP8 checkpoints; that is simply not exercised, so v1.2.0 is
the oldest version stated here rather than the oldest that works.

Model Support Matrix
--------------------

What this matrix is based on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entries are drawn from the release deployment suite,
`tests/examples/hf_ptq/test_deploy.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/tests/examples/hf_ptq/test_deploy.py>`_.
For each entry it loads the exported checkpoint in the framework and generates from four short text
prompts, asserting that each returns non-empty output.

Two limits are worth stating plainly, because they bound what any ✅ below can mean:

* **These are declared cases, not PR-gated coverage.** The suite is marked ``release`` and collects
  only when pytest is given ``--run-release``, which no workflow in ``.github/workflows/`` currently
  passes. A green check on a pull request does not mean these cases ran.
* **Each case is a load-and-generate smoke check on the text path.** It does not verify accuracy,
  image or audio inputs, diffusion output, or that speculative decoding actually engages.

Legend:

* ✅ — declared in the release deployment suite, subject to the two limits above.
* ⚠ — expected to work, but not a suite entry: either carried over from earlier documentation, or
  present as a case that does not exercise the feature the row names.
* ``-`` — not in the suite. It may still work; see `Models not listed here`_.

Vision-language and multimodal models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For VLMs, modelopt quantizes the language model only; the vision encoder is kept in high precision.
The exported checkpoint therefore relies on the serving framework's own multimodal support for that
architecture — see the
`TensorRT-LLM multimodal support matrix <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/models/supported-models.md#multimodal-feature-support-matrix-pytorch-backend>`_.

.. important::
   ✅ in this table is **text-only smoke coverage**. The suite sends the same plain-text prompts it
   uses for language models, so no image or audio input reaches the processor or vision encoder.
   These entries show that the quantized checkpoint loads and that its language path generates —
   they do not demonstrate multimodal serving.

Speculative decoding drafters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drafters are deployed on top of their base checkpoint.

Two caveats specific to this table:

* **Most entries are doubly conditional.** Beyond the ``--run-release`` gate, the drafter cases in
  ``test_eagle`` also require ``MODELOPT_LOCAL_EAGLE_MODEL`` to point at a directory containing the
  drafter, and skip otherwise. The exception is EAGLE3 for Kimi K2.6, which is declared in
  ``test_kimi`` without that gate — which is also why it is the one row with vLLM coverage.
* **Medusa is marked ⚠ because the case does not exercise Medusa.** The shared harness builds a
  speculative-decoding configuration only when the model ID contains ``eagle``, so the Medusa entry
  performs ordinary generation. It shows the checkpoint loads and serves; it does not validate
  Medusa decoding.

Wan 2.2 is marked ⚠ because its cases run through the same autoregressive text helper as the
language models and assert on generated text. They never call a diffusion or video serving API, so
they do not substantiate text-to-video deployment.

.. note::
   NVFP4 inference requires Blackwell GPUs. Hopper can produce an NVFP4 checkpoint but cannot serve
   it. On B300/GB300 (``sm_103``) use a CUDA-13 build of the serving framework; CUDA-12 builds lack
   the ``sm_103`` FP4 kernels.

Models not listed here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This matrix records the combinations modelopt validates. It is not an exhaustive list of what will
run: vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM load unified HF checkpoints generically, so a model built from
standard ``nn.Linear`` layers with an ``hf_quant_config.json`` will often deploy without any modelopt
change. Check the serving framework's own model support list first, then try it.

The exact checkpoints behind every ✅ above, including tensor-parallel size and minimum SM
version, are listed in
`tests/examples/hf_ptq/test_deploy.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/tests/examples/hf_ptq/test_deploy.py>`__;
most are published under the
